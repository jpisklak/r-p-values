# Calculating $p$-Values in R: A Quick and Dirty Guide

This repository provides a simple HTML-based guide for calculating $p$-values using the R programming language.

Historically, statistics instruction has relied heavily on printed tables to teach students how to determine $p$-values. This guide, `index.html`, presents a more modern and reproducible approach that leverages R code to perform these calculations directly. It is designed as a lightweight reference for students and instructors who want a fast, code-first alternative to traditional lookup methods.

**Note:** This guide does *not* offer a conceptual deep dive into the meaning, limitations, or appropriate use of $p$-values. It is intended strictly as a practical coding reference for computing them in R.
